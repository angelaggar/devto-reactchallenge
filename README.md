Hi!

I'm proud to share this project with youðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰.

My name is Angela Donaji Garcia Garcia, and I have worked to make this app possible ðŸ¤“

This is a Next.js application in which an aesthetic clone of the Dev.to page was made, styled with Tailwind-css.

The app guarantees that once a new user is created, you will be able to log in and access the functionalities to create a new post and view it at the end of the list.

After that, by clicking on each of the posts, you will be redirected to view the writing of each one.

Be sure to fulfill every space, our forms are programmed to detect that eery space have a value ðŸ‘€

You can preview the use of the app through this link:



## Installing our new app for develop
Install next dependencies, babel, clsx, react-hook-forms :


```bash
npm create next-app@latest

npm install clsx

npm install react-hook-form

npm i --save @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
```


## Getting Started

Now, run the development server:


```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
